# Design Patterns
In software engineering, a Design Pattern describes an established solution to the most commonly encountered problems in software design. 
Design patterns represent formalized best practices that can be used to solve common problems when designing an application.

## Creational Design Patterns
- Abstract factory
> Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Builder
> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
- Dependency Injection
> A class accepts the objects it requires from an injector instead of creating the objects directly.
- Factory method
> Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Structural Design Patterns
- Decorator
> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Behavioral Design Patterns


## Concurrency Design Patterns
